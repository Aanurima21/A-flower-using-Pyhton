# A-flower-using-Pyhton

This a project where a flower is created using the turtle module in pyhton. <br><br>
<b>Turtle Module:</b>
“Turtle” is a Python feature like a drawing board, which lets us command a turtle to draw all over it! We can use functions like turtle.forward(…) and turtle.right(…) which can move the turtle around.

To use the turtle module:
<li>import turtle. Syntax: from turtle import *</li>
<li>Create a turtle to control</li>
<li>Draw your imaginations. Remember sky is the limit.</li>
<li>At the end, write: turtle.end()</li>
