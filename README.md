# A-flower-using-Pyhton

This a project where a flower is created using the turtle module in pyhton.
<b>Turtle Module:</b>
“Turtle” is a Python feature like a drawing board, which lets us command a turtle to draw all over it! We can use functions like turtle.forward(…) and turtle.right(…) which can move the turtle around.
